INTRODUCTION
------------

PyDiveLog is an open-source SCUBA dive log program written in Python and PySide 
(Qt4).  It aims to replicate the features of advanced dive logging programs
while maintaining an easy-to-use interface adequate for both casual divers and
dive pros.  Logbooks are stored with an open SQLite schema which is simple to
backup and access with third-party programs.  By using standard software such as
Python, Qt4, and SQLite, PyDiveLog can be run on Windows, OS X, or Linux.

PyDiveLog also supports native transfers from popular dive computer models. 
Using pure Python plugins, drivers and parsers for new dive computers can be
added easily.  Currently PyDiveLog supports the Uwatec Smart line of dive
computers using IrDA, with more to be added in the future.  To connect to IrDA
(infrared) dive computers, the python-irda module must be installed on your
system (https://github.com/asymworks/python-irda).

DEVELOPMENT
-----------

PyDiveLog is still under heavy development as time and ambition allow.  There
is a complete dive computer transfer program included (qdcxfer.py) which will
download dives from supported dive computers and store them in the Logbook 
format.
